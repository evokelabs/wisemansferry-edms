<p class="text-center">With 15,000 sq/m of crystal blue water, Wisemans Surf Lodge in the Hawkesbury is the first of its size to break waves, which begin in the middle of the pool. Firing off in either direction, every wave length offers a 10-12 sec ride, creating the most ocean-like experience possible.</p>

  <p class="text-center">Each wave is also powered by Surfloch’s pneumatics technology.</p>
