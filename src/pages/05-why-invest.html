<p>Hungry for perfect A-frames, we went searching for a solution to over-crowded, poor quality waves in the city – something that would redefine the Sydney surf experience but also create a special community of surfers.</p>

<p>BALNCE, as the operator of the lodge, will provide a priority offer of membership to investors in the Wisemans Surf Lodge Property Trust, but membership is non-compulsory.</p>
<spacer size="15"></spacer>
<p>Different levels of membership unlock different access to sessions in the wave pool and nights in the hotel, but all members can freely access the restaurant, bar, clubhouse, golf course and all lodge amenities. Members may share their access rights with up to three friends or their entire immediate family.</p>
